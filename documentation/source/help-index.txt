Does Fuglu run with python3?
............................

(Last updated Jun '18): Since version 0.8.0 Fuglu runs on python3. Note that custom plugins might need to be adapted
to work correctly when switching from python2 to python3.

How can I submit changes to the documentation?
..............................................

The fuglu documentation is  in the branch ``gh-pages``, please edit the text files in the ``source`` folder and submit a pull request.

How do I upgrade/downgrade Fuglu?
.................................

Just install the new (or downgrade ) version, overwriting the previous one. There are usually no breaking changes.
